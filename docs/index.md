## About me
I live in Aotearoa / New Zealand. I'm interested in Computer Science, Software Development, Politics, History, Game Design (Video Games in general too), and Computer Security.  
I am currently studying Computer Science.

## Video Games that I play
I used to play a lot of HOI4, but I don't really anymore. I'm probably going to play it again one day.  
I'm a big fan of Sea of Thieves, Space Engineers, EU4, Stellaris, and CIV6. I still play a lot of other games though.  
Currently most of my free time inside is spent rotting on TF2. Doesn't mean I'm good at it though.

## Languages
I'm fluent in English, and I *was* learning German in my own time just for fun. I'm also interested in learning Mandarin Chinese and Te Reo MƒÅori... eventually...

## Timezone
UTC+13 during daylight savings time, UTC+12 when it's not daylight savings time. Just Google it or something!
